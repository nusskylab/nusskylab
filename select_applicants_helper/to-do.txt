        failure cases

# admin side
    prepare peer evaluation
        when size is valid:
        no team self evaluate / same-team members eval the same team

    edit peer evaluation
        add, remove correctly

    rank applicants
        scores calculated correctly
            if assigned evaluator never submits eval, remove from score calculation
        evaluatee, evaluator, project proposal displayed correctly
        peer eval missing identified correctly
        repeated submission affects the score?
