  <p style="color: red;">Note while the Orbital course is not officially finished until Splashdown, whether the target team passes Orbital and what level of achievement they will receive is based solely on the project's status at this (Evaluation 3) milestone; you should not credit or factor in any promise of improved functionality between Evaluation 3 and the Splashdown showcase. Teams are encouraged to continue working on their projects all the way up to and beyond Splashdown, but these modifications will not affect the team's achievement level or S/U mark.</p>
