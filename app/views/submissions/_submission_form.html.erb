    <p>You may place a single line hyperlink to another system (e.g., Google Docs) for any of the deliverables listed below (especially for the video and poster links), but do feel free to use the editor here to make it easier for your evaluators (one less click).  
    <p>&nbsp;
    <p>For the Project README, there are different goals per project milestone.  Make sure you check out the evaluation form (<i>Preview Forms &laquo; Milestone X &laquo; Peer Evaluation</i>) for the milestone to ensure your README captures the necessary details for your evaluators to critically assess your work.  Remember, documentation is the only means that peers have to really get a feel for what you've done.  For all submissions, do include your proposed 1) level of achievement, 2) project scope (one sentence version and a longer descriptive version), 3) 
       <ol>
         <li><b>Milestone 1 (Ideation):</b> include problem motivation and proposed core features / user stories</li>
         <li><b>Milestone 2 (Prototyping):</b> include core features developed, problems encountered</li>
         <li><b>Milestone 3 (Refinement):</b> include bugs squashed, edge features developed, problems encountered, and user testing</li>
      </ol>

    <p>For the Project Log, document each team member's hours towards meeting or exceeding the hourly goal (140 hours minimum for each team member).  Keep your logs at the resolution of hours (not fractions), and include time in designing, meeting up, learning a technology (reading up, watching videos), debugging and coding.  Best practice is to use a table or list with a task description, date (range), additional remarks and a column for hours for each team member.  The goal is to convince your evaluators that what you spent was reasonable for the tasks done.  Do put a summary at the top of your document.</p>
