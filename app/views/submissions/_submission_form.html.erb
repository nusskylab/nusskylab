  <p>&nbsp;
  <p>For the Project README, there are different goals per project milestone. Make sure you check out the evaluation
    form (<i>Preview Forms &laquo; Milestone X &laquo; Peer Evaluation</i>) for the milestone to ensure your README
    captures the necessary details for your evaluators to critically assess your work. Remember, documentation is the
    only means that peers have to really get a feel for what you've done. For all submissions, do include your proposed
    1) level of achievement, 2) project scope (one sentence version and a longer descriptive version), 3)
  <ol>
    <li><b>Milestone 1 (Ideation):</b> include problem motivation and proposed core features / user stories</li>
    <li><b>Milestone 2 (Prototyping):</b> include core features developed, problems encountered</li>
    <li><b>Milestone 3 (Refinement):</b> include bugs squashed, edge features developed, problems encountered, and user
      testing
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>For the Project Log, document each team member's hours towards meeting or exceeding the hourly goal (140 hours
    minimum for each team member). Keep your logs at the resolution of hours (not fractions), and include time in
    designing, meeting up, learning a technology (reading up, watching videos), debugging and coding. Best practice is
    to use a table or list with a task description, date (range), additional remarks and a column for hours for each
    team member. The goal is to convince your evaluators that what you spent was reasonable for the tasks done. Do put a
    summary at the top of your document.</p>
