Orbital is the School of Computing`s self-driven programming summer experience. It is designed to give first-year students the opportunity to self-learn and build something useful\cite{citation0}. As more and more students join Orbital program, administration of the program and evaluations among teams are becoming increasingly challenging. Therefore, Skylab is designed and implemented to help students to submit submissions and evaluate other teams with ease as well as to help the administrator of Orbital program overlook and manage this module well. In this project, we find and solve real-life problems faced by students, advisors and administrators of Orbital program with an extensible system design and continuous contribution in an agile software development process.

I would like to express my most sincere appreciation to my project supervisor and project
administrator, Dr. Min-Yen Kan. Throughout this project, it was him who tirelessly
provided me with significant support and assistance. I would also like to appreciate Orbital Program advisers and students for suggesting many useful features and bringing up issues to make Skylab more usable.
